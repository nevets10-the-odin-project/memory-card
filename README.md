## Introduction

Here we go again with a new project! Let's make sure you understand the concepts so far. The main goal of this project is to implement the concepts learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

### How the game works

Go play around with this [student's solution](https://heldersrvio.github.io/memory-card-game/) to find out for yourself how the Memory game works. Although this example uses cartoon characters, you can use anything you like for your game.

## Post project review

This was actually very fun to do. It was also very quick...relatively.

Note (04/10/25): I just realized that everything is too big. That's probably because I had the browser open on my smaller laptop monitor and not my main monitor.
